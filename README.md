# Espressif 32: development platform for [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) for Linux hosting

This is a fork of the original [platformio/platform-espressif32](https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32) with added support for building using the native Linux toolchain.
Note: most of the orignal code for running/uploading on/to real hardware has been removed or disabled in this fork.
